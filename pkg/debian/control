Description: Convert a TTY from one encoding to another
 ttyconv uses the GNU C Library's iconv(3) facility to translate a TTY
 connection from one character encoding to another.
 .
 This is useful when, for instance, you have a UTF-8 based desktop
 with national language and keyboard support and you still want to
 connect to systems that are unaware of this, or use a different
 encoding.
